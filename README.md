# Clojurescript for Javascript Developers

A talk I'm giving at DenverScript on Jan 26 2015 (on [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/DenverScript/events/226432468/)).

This talk is also an experiment in formatting. It is formatted as a series of [devcards](https://github.com/bhauman/devcards) pages, with an added "hack" to focus on a single card as if its a slide. This formatting allows the presenter to live edit the talk, just like devcards and figwheel and emacs provide live development. This will hopefully help show the attendees the ease of developing with clojurescript through the ease of editing the talk.

The non-live version is available via github pages [here](http://joneisen.me/talk-clojurescript-for-javascript-devs).

## Setup

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein figwheel

and open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).
This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

    lein clean

To create a production build run:

    lein cljsbuild once min

And open your browser in `resources/public/index.html`. You will not
get live reloading, nor a REPL.

### Slideshow

A simple (and hacky) devcards slideshow interface was developed. Simply hit <Enter> or click "Start Slideshow" to start, then arrow keys to navigate and <ESC> to exit the slideshow mode.

The slideshow mode will focus on a specific card with css's `zoom` and put a transparent overlay on other cards.
